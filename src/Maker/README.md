# Author

Private (i.e API is not publicly exposed) component that determines the maker.

## API

### `identifier (optional; string)`

When specified, is used to format the displayed author.

If no `identifier` is specified, `null` is returned.

When `identifier` receives an email address, it creates a hyperlink with a `mailto` URL (using the given email address) and a trailing [`FontAwesome` `envelope` icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons/envelope?style=solid). The displayed value associated with the `mailto` URL is the `display` prop value or the given email address.

When `identifier` receives a URL, it creates a hyperlink that points to the given URL and a trailing [`FontAwesome` `link` icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons/link?style=solid).

The only exceptions to this are when the URL has a `twitter.com` or `github.com` host, when the icons are the [`FontAwesome` `Twitter` icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons/twitter?style=brands) and the [`FontAwesome` `GitHub` icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons/github?style=brands)

The displayed value associated with the hyperlink is the `display` prop value or the given URL.

If the `identifier` is not an email address or a URL, it is wrapped in a `<span>`, unless the `display` prop is defined.

### `display(optional; string, element)`

When specified, is the displayed value that represents the maker.

### `showIcon (optional; boolean)`

Determines whether or not to show the icon generated by analyzing the `identifier` prop

### `iconColor (optional; string)`

Determines the color of any icon generated by analyzing the `identifier` prop
